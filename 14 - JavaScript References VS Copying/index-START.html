      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      const team2 = players.slice(); // slice without params takes a copy

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
        social: {
          twitter: 'one',
          faceboo: 'two',
        },
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
      //<!--# blank object, thing to assign, and any custom props  -->
      //<!--! Only goes 1 level deep though,  -->

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      cap3.social.twitter = 'will-twitter';
      cap3.name = 'will';
      console.log(cap3, 'copy');
      console.log(person, 'original person');
      //<!--# Object spread now exists
      //<!--! Also Only goes 1 level deep though,  -->

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      //if you REALLY need to deep clone w/o a specialized fxn (though some performance issues) you can:
      const deepclone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
